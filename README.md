# complex_number_game
This is the lean4 version of the complex number gameï¼Œwhich we tried to translate from lean3 version of the game. 


For lean3 version of the complex number game, see https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game.git

# Instructions
## The tutorial Level
Level 0: The tutorial level, is at Complex/Level_00_basic.lean. All solutions are given. Read through this code first, and refer back to it if necessary.

In the tutorial level we define 0, 1, +, - and *, and prove that the complex numbers are a ring.

## The main levels
Open the relevant project files in VS Code and fill in all the sorrys.

Level 1: the natural map from the reals to the complexes, is at Complex/Level_01_of_real.lean

Level 2: sqrt(-1), is at Complex/Level_02_I.lean
